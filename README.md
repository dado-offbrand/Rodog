# Rodog v3 development project

> - Rodog v1 had brownouts all over and was not optimal for goals
> - Rodog v2 was unfinished but the design was changed too much so a v3 was created
> - Rodog v3 is a work in progress, Rodog v3 Trello: https://trello.com/c/BKIzcXdK/53-main-branch

# Rodog v3 notes

> - Almost all rodog resources are hand drawn now, no more resources folder needed
> - All resources are now held on Trello

# Rodog v3 extra info

> - MG995 servos
> - Panhead screws for exterior, hidden socket head screws (all screw are m5-.8x16 and m5-.8x20)
> - Uses controller used on Titan submersible for control (temp. not in use as its too early in the assembly stage)
> - Uses a modular design scheme in order to make rodog as simple in design as possible
> - Doesn't use exact 1:2 torque ratio for speed, but it uses a 1:decimal_here ratio to add a bit of speed to joint movement
> - Mostly printed of PLA, some PVC pipe is used as internal support for body
> - No springs are utilized *yet*
